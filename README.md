	Project Title: Titanic Survival Rate Prediction using Logistic Regression

	Objective: The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more.

	Dataset: The dataset used for this project is often the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers such as age, gender, class, fare, and whether they survived or not.

	Methodology: The project follows these key steps:
1.	Data Preprocessing:
•	Handling missing values: Impute or remove missing values in the dataset.
•	Encoding categorical variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical format.

2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Identifying relationships and patterns in the data.
•	Visualizing survival rates based on different factors.

3.	Feature Selection:
•	Identifying and selecting relevant features that have a significant impact on survival prediction.

4.	Model Building:
•	Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
•	Building a logistic regression model using the training data.

5.	Model Training:
•	Training the logistic regression model on the training dataset.

6.	Model Evaluation:
•	Testing the trained model on the testing dataset to assess its generalization ability.

	Results:
The logistic regression model provides a probability score for each passenger, indicating their likelihood of survival.

	Conclusion:
•	The logistic regression model demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting the survival rate of Titanic passengers based on the selected features.
•	Insights gained from the analysis can be used to understand the factors influencing survival on the Titanic.
